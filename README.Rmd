The goal of jamestools is to be a set of convenience functions to my personal development work. I double these are of interest to most, but it's a convenient place to play with package building tools without breaking something others want to use.

## Installation

You can install the development version of jamestools like so:

``` r
require(remotes)
remotes::install_github("JamesHWade/jamestools")
```

## Search

Ag - the Silver Searcher is a convenient search function I use all the time in the terminal. `ag()` gives you a function to call that in the R console.

```{r example}
library(jamestools)
ag("dplyr", filetype = "R")
```
